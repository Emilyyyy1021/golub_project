# golub_project
containing data and code for golub gene expression

I've set up the files for this project in a suggested way to organize an analysis project in 
a reproducible way i.e. so someone could come in and reproduce your analysis! Or you 3 years from now
could come in and reproduce what you did if you forgot!

In the`code` file I usually separate my data processing and analysis into separate files, and title them
based on the order in which the files should be run to reproduce the analysis. 

In the `data` folder I usually put the raw data in one folder, and save processed data in another.

I save output in the `results` folder, and contain background papers or information in the `background` folder.


I use an `.Rproj` environment to conduct the whole analysis.
